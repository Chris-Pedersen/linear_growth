# linear_growth
Repo to keep track of linear growth issues in Gadget variants. We run a comparison of the linear growth (by setting 1% amplitude) in MP-Gadget (https://github.com/MP-Gadget/MP-Gadget) and Gadget-3, and compare the power spectra in simulations to linear theory.

For MP-Gadget, we use GenPK (https://github.com/sbird/GenPK) to calculate simulation power spectra, and classylss (https://github.com/nickhand/classylss) to generate linear theory power spectra.

For Gadget-3, we use reps (https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps) along with CAMB to generate power spectra, and Pylians (https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/Pylians) to calculate the power spectra in the simulations.
